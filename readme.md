# Effective Exchange Rates App

This app aims to provide a somewhat flexible frontend interface to display the [public data](https://data.bis.org/topics/EER/data?selected_ts=BIS%2CWS_EER%2C1.0%255ED.N.N%2BB.IE%2CM.N.N%2BB.IE%2CM.R.N%2BB.IE%2CD%2BM.N.B.IL%2CM.R.B.IL%2BIT%2CD.N.N%2BB.IT%2CM.N%2BR.N.IT%2CM.N.B.IT%2BJP%2CD.N.N%2BB.JP%2CM.N%2BR.N.JP&page_size=100) provided by [BIS](https://data.bis.org).

## What are Effective Exchange Rate Indexes ?

An [EER index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_exchange_rate) is a measure of the value of a country's currency relative to a basket of foreign currencies over time. The index is calculated by comparing the current EER to a base period, which is usually set to equal 100. If the EER increases over time, it means that the currency is appreciating in value relative to the basket of foreign currencies. If the EER decreases over time, it means that the currency is depreciating in value relative to the basket of foreign currencies.

## Goals & Stack

This is the front end part of the EER API project, you can check the [backend here](https://github.com/rebecaaras/eer-api). It is mainly meant for my own learning. Some topics I had to approach for this project include (with the respective chosen technologies):

- Basic Databases Design and Setup (Postgres + Rails Active Record)
- API Development (Ruby on Rails)
- Front-end client consuming the API (React + TypeScript)
- Componentization and Responsiveness (I mostly relied on [Shadcn-UI](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui))

## Technical Decisions

As I go through this project many small decisions are made in all layers, you can go to [Decisions & Comments](decisions.md) to have a closer look on my process.
